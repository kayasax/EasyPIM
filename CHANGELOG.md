# EasyPIM Changelog

All notable changes to the EasyPIM project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [EasyPIM Core 2.0.30] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- Hardened `Test-PIMPolicyBusinessRules` to strip conflicting AuthenticationContext entries from activation requirement arrays.
- Updated `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity` to surface invalid activation requirements before deployment and align template normalization with runtime behavior.

### Improved
- Assignment validation now requires both scope and role when checking existing Azure entries, preventing status strings from blocking new assignments.

## [EasyPIM.Orchestrator 1.4.7] - 2025-10-11

### Fixed
- Azure assignment pre-checks ignore status-only strings and enforce scope + role matches before skipping creations.
- `Test-EasyPIMConfigurationValidity` removes stray AuthenticationContext activation requirements that would fail during deployment.

### Changed
- `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` reuses orchestrator normalization when available so drift detection mirrors live execution.

## [EasyPIM.Orchestrator 1.4.5] - 2025-10-08

### Added
- Support array-based policy definitions for Azure, Entra, and group roles with template override handling.
- Added dedicated documentation and sample configuration for the new array-based policy format.

### Fixed
- `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` now compares template-based policies using the resolved policy payload generated by the orchestrator, restoring drift accuracy.
- Removed trailing whitespace flagged by FileIntegrity tests to keep module validation clean.

## [EasyPIM.Orchestrator 1.2.0] - 2025-09-03

### ðŸš¨ Critical
- **FIXED**: Critical scope mismatch bug in `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` causing false "Match" results
- **SECURITY**: Scope validation now matches policy application behavior preventing false positives

### Fixed
- Fixed drift detection always using subscription scope instead of policy-specific scopes
- Enhanced `Test-PIMPolicyDrift` to use scope-aware policy validation
- Added verbose logging to show which scope is being used for drift detection
- Resolved cases where Azure resource policies failed to apply but drift showed "Match"

### Enhanced
- Improved debug output in telemetry functions
- Enhanced KeyVault configuration support in telemetry

### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Drift detection queried subscription-level policies while orchestrator applied resource-specific policies
- **Impact**: Azure resource policies (e.g., Contributor at storage account scope) would fail but appear correctly configured
- **Solution**: Enhanced drift detection to validate at the same scope as policy application
- **Evidence**: 400 Bad Request on policy apply vs "Match" in drift detection for same role

## [EasyPIM.Orchestrator 1.1.9] - 2025-09-03

### Fixed
- Fixed telemetry variable name bugs preventing KeyVault configuration telemetry
- Corrected `$loadedConfig` to `$config` variable references in orchestrator
- Enhanced telemetry functions with SHA256 fallback identifier creation
- Improved debug output for telemetry troubleshooting

### Enhanced
- Added `Send-TelemetryEventFromConfig` function for config object-based telemetry
- Enhanced error handling in telemetry functions with non-blocking fallbacks
- Added color-coded debug messages for better troubleshooting

## [EasyPIM Core 2.0.12] - 2025-09-03

### Fixed
- Fixed corrupted `Invoke-ARM.ps1` file with duplicate code blocks
- Removed duplicate try-catch sections and extra closing braces
- Resolved PowerShell parser errors in CI/CD environments

### Validation
- All 6,973+ tests now pass successfully
- Complete build validation restored

## [EasyPIM.Orchestrator 1.1.8] - 2025-08-31

### Added
- Policy template merge feature with inline property overrides
- Support for base templates with custom property modifications
- Enhanced EntraRoles.Policies, AzureRoles.Policies, and GroupRoles.Policies sections

### Changed
- Removed unnecessary `Microsoft.Graph.Identity.Governance` dependency
- Optimized module dependencies after code analysis
- Updated to use only `Microsoft.Graph.Authentication` cmdlets

### Enhanced
- Template resolution with non-Template property copying as overrides
- Improved dependency management and module loading

## [EasyPIM Core 2.0.11] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- Proactive PowerShell Gallery version checking
- Build script fail-fast for existing versions
- Systematic CI/CD reliability improvements

### Changed
- Enhanced build process to prevent version conflicts
- Improved error handling in publishing workflow

### Fixed
- Prevented repeated pipeline failures from version conflicts
- Reduced wasted CI cycles through early validation

## [EasyPIM 2.0.x Series] - 2025-08-27 to 2025-08-29

### Major Changes
- **Architecture**: Complete module separation into Core + Orchestrator
- **Dependencies**: Clean internal function duplication, no shared dependencies
- **Publishing**: Independent versioning and release cycles
- **Documentation**: Updated guides for two-module architecture

### Added
- EasyPIM.Orchestrator as standalone module
- Tag-based publishing (core-v*, orchestrator-v*)
- Comprehensive policy orchestration system
- Enterprise-grade reliability features

### Enhanced
- Flattened module structure with UTF-8 BOM support
- Gallery version validation in build process
- Improved CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
